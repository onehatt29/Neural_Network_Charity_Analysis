# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

#  The dummy Notebook of the Alphabet soup Charity is the create a machine learning model to train and test a dummy dataset.
#   The trained model will be used to

##  During the preprocessing stage of the Neural network model the model is cleaned up for further analysis. 
##  During this stage the model is used to analyze the charity data using a neural network, during this stage we can pull numbers from the data based on choosing criteria.
##  The variables are broking down into category. During this phase of the analysis the data is prepared for machine learning.

##  During the optimization process what we are looking for is a more accurate way to get a prediction based on the model we have.
